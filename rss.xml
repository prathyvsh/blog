I organized about 2 hackathons a year since then. I went to about 6 Hackathons in 2019 to 2020 February. I don’t know why but I just love going to Hackathons. The energy you feel at a Hackathon can be found nowhere else. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People usually when speaking of Hackathons, they define that Hackathons are just a sprint where you solve a problem statement and live on. While this is true, in the case of an Enterprise mode event but the word ‘Hackathon’ among the Student Developer community should have a much wider definition. This is quite relative but they all convey the same meaning opposite to what people usually refer to. &lt;strong&gt;Joe Nash&lt;/strong&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jna_sh&quot;&gt;@jna_sh&lt;/a&gt;) whom I look up to as a mentor and the Guru of Hackathons once told us(&lt;em&gt;Campus Experts&lt;/em&gt;) about &lt;strong&gt;Hackathons&lt;/strong&gt; that,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;” There’s nowhere else in the world you can spend 24 hours in a room full of people who are passionate about what you’ew passionate about, who all want to help each other learn and grow. That’s the story to tell 😍”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s the definition I would use. Since this definition gives better insights and expectations to a Hackathon and this is what happens at one. This is a gem of a quote I’d say&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why participate in a Hackathon?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why not participate in a Hackathon????? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from the unlimited(limited) amount of swags you’ll get like stickers, T-shirts, some electronics… Hackathons are another way of enjoying tech as a whole. It encapsulates the meaning of community and technology. From a personal side note on the free stuff, the First Hackathon I went got me about 8 T-shirts, a bag, 2 books and stickers. When I came home, my dad jokingly said that &lt;em&gt;“you’ll only need a laptop and an internet connection and we wouldn’t need to buy any clothes for you”&lt;/em&gt;. This has a wider perspective of thought and this is what the student hackers are becoming too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VakF2hZFPQ&quot;&gt;TED Talk&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;strong&gt;Dave Fontenot, The Organizer of Mhacks, Michigan&lt;/strong&gt; he said something similar to the below words&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hackathons are like drugs, it gives you an immense amount of Concentration and Productivity”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This statement is true. For that to understand you must attend a hackathon and be part of the community. That’s where the real vibe starts. The real #LIFEHACKR moment begins. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What’s holding you down?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people tell to me that they think hackathons are for hackers, like the guys who sit in front of their laptops and type something normal people don’t understand and “hack” stuff. This “hacking” is true. But the term “hacking” to refers to building something at a hackathon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You go to a hackathon and become a Hacker and not the way Around”- Dave Fontenot&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the other type of people is that they think they aren’t qualified enough or doesn’t know enough to go to a hackathon. Frankly speaking, my first Hackathon was Ethereum Based, nearly half a year from there, I still don’t what Ethereum is. We made a Jugaad and submitted that rather than that I wasn’t interested in Ethereum but since I got an Opportunity, I seized that. See you don’t need to be qualified in anything to go to a hackathon. This is where the inclusivity factor kicks in. Hackers welcome you… No matter who you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Best Things at a Hackathon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Brainstorming:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wooooooooo, that’s the best thing. That’s where you feel the energy and confidence of your teammates come rushing in. There was this hack called OpenHack which was held in Kochi. The Hack was for making solutions for future floods in Kerala. It was well planned and well funded, the only thing lacking was the idea of what to build. Yeah, the tagline had the idea on what to build but the hackers found it hard to innovate on that. They all used a single API which was written at another hackathon and at the end it broke. So the organizers and volunteers(including me) took on to plan for what will be the future of the whole idea behind the project. That’s when the real energy sparked. The top student developers in all of Kerala, hackers and engineers came together to make the future of the project better. We discussed from which platform we’ll use for tracking to which CSS framework we’ll use. Man, that was the best thing at that hackathon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Hacking&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yep, the main part. This is where you become God. You create. You ideate. You build. You become one with your team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Networking&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll make friends. If you’re a sticker encyclopedia(like me), you’ll find more. Once I started a convo with a person by asking him how he got a specific octocat sticker on his laptop. Then I and his team became instant friends. This happens when you relate to their thinking. A guy who loves stickers is a guy who is in the field. He’ll know stuff and he’ll be the best resource person to help you on your build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Learning&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the output. Rather than a drowsy head and cursing yourself after on drugs, you won’t get that in this drug. Yes, this drug will make you go get it more often but trust me that is worth the effort. The things you’ll learn will be the best things you’ll learn in your life, the best skills you’ll ever acquire. You’ll learn ‘Teamwork’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Students and Hackathons&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a student being in College/School and interested in Technology, a Hackathon is the best place to boost your passion. You can find many people of the same &lt;em&gt;“wavelength”&lt;/em&gt;. You can learn a lot from them. They’ll help you a lot. From my personal experience, I went to HackCamp in Kochi both for taking a workshop and hacking. The thing was that I used to know React a few months ago. At the time of the Hack, react was miles away from my brain. Since I didn’t know much Js, react was coming hard on me. One of my Hacker friends Akhil Mohan from RIT and Mohit Rajan from FISAT helped me so much on my project. I knew Akhil from another hackathon and I met Mohit just there. The learning experience I got was out of the world. I kinda learned so much of React, Wikipedia and Torrents. This is kind of a sample of the learning experiences at a Hackathon.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I reckon that students will learn more in Hackathons than they learn in college/school. This is my personal opinion so, you have all the power to take it as it is or drop it. This improved self-learning capability is the best thing they’ll be acquiring since this will be integral in their Future Endeavours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The State of Hackathons in Kerala, India&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kerala is a small state in India. It has a rich student developer community and I’m proud to say that I’m a part of it. The thing is that most of the Hackathons I’ve gone to have an underdeveloped way of Judging. This was a serious case and many hackers in my circle have stopped coming for hacks in Kerala due to this drawback. My point is that student hackathons should never be for starting a business or for starting a startup. It is organized by the community for the experience and the fun. I’ve seen hackers getting disappointed when the judges say dumb things like “This business model is not good” or “Why did you build something that’s already in the market?“. I’ve seen Judges giving first prizes to a shitty Waste Management Systems. Damn, I could write that in half a day with my teammates. Where is the innovation in that I would ask? At a hackathon, we got judged for our Translation model that Google has better models than us and we 5 won’t be able to complete that even if we sat for a 100 years working for that. Yeah, the Judges may have 3x10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; years of experience but what’s the point if they couldn’t understand the idea of a student hackathon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, this is the first evil that I say to the organizers of a hackathon I’m asked to help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But every once in a while some good hackathons come too in Kerala. This might be a small one but it’ll be the best ones. I’ve been proven right multiple times. Most colleges don’t have a standalone hackathon in their colleges. Either they’ll be part of their technical fest. Only a handful in my knowledge does standalone hackathons here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My say on Hackathons&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to hack your tech life is to get to a Hackathon. Be a part of that culture and the community. Give feedback on where the organizers or your teammates should improve. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“All power is within you. You can do anything and everything. Believe in that” - Swami Vivekananda&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might be thinking why I started with a quote by Swami Vivekananda. This quote has been a driving factor in my pursuits to learn new things and building stuff and moving forward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been into Go for about 2 months now. I just wrote up two hacks in Go too. One was &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/athul/shelby&quot;&gt;Shelby&lt;/a&gt; and now lemme introduce you to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/athul/pwcli&quot;&gt;Postwoman CLI&lt;/a&gt;. As the name says It’s a CLI client for &lt;a href=&quot;https://postwoman.io&quot;&gt;Postwoman 👽&lt;/a&gt;  in Go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The ‘0’ 👦&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning either Go or Rust was in my TODO list of 2019. It was only in late 2019, I had reached the mindset to learn Go. I started out on tutorials in building servers in Go. I used to code servers in Python and falled for Backend Programming. I made a bunch of servers in Go with Gin. Go was intimidating at first since it felt more like C to me, but in a few days I got the clutch of it. I still don’t actually know most of Go like using slices and goroutines that much. I learn mostly by building so, I learn when I build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The ‘-1’ 👶&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I met Liyas Thomas, the author of Postwoman in the official Telegram Group of Postwoman. Since he too was from the state of Kerala, we had a few convos. I had opened a PR to Postwoman when it launched in August-September but it didn’t get merged due to my lack of Vue/Js. But later on I had a chat with him if I did a refactor PR. He really gave me the confidence to do that and I did. The PR was reviewed and made changes by the Maintainers of PW and where it started in 1 commit it changed to 8 and the diff was &lt;strong&gt;+8k and -8k&lt;/strong&gt;. The PR got merged and I was the &lt;strong&gt;#11 Contributor of PW 🎉.&lt;/strong&gt; The PR didn’t give me any satisfaction but later after 2 days, Liyas send me a bug and told me to try to fix that. I traversed over 2k lines of Vue code and found the bug. He made a commit and fixed it. This bug squashing gave me much satisfaction than all the contributions I’ve done. Later that week, a maintainer and My Friend James made a repo for a CLI in Js. So the idea for making another CLI was basically for learning for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The ‘1’ 👨&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, Liyas gave a Green Flag to work on the CLI. I considered Go as first option since I didnt know how to make one in any lang and Go was fresh in my mind. I built it in almost 2 weeks. &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;pwcli&lt;/code&gt; is like &lt;em&gt;httpie&lt;/em&gt; with displaying the Request Headers and Status Code and Output Highlighting. The Output is now limited to Json but will add support to HTML and XML in the coming days. &lt;strong&gt;It also has a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;send&lt;/code&gt; feature in which you can give it the Postwoman-Collection.json file and it will test all the endpoints in their respective methods and output the status code&lt;/strong&gt;. This was actually a feature request in the Js counterpart of the CLI.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;NAME:

&lt;h2&gt;The ‘+1’ 👨‍💻&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these two weeks, I’ve learned a lot of Go, HTTP Requests and REST APIs. The main highlights were&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learned Go Structs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to parse Json in Go&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learned Go Slices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learned how to use &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;net/http&lt;/code&gt; package of
Go&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HTTP Requests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meeting the Postwoman team, especially from Kerala&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Homebrew Packaging and bits of Ruby&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building CLIs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My insecurity with starting a convo with new people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taking a workshop &lt;em&gt;(by actually taking one)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, when you’re reading this, I am 2020% sure that you wont be in 2019.😝&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2020 ended as every year ends, FAST and obviously fucked. Mine was just same… There were a lot of good things that happened like making this blog and becoming old. 2019 wasn’t that harsh on &lt;strong&gt;me&lt;/strong&gt; like the years before that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got to do a lot of stuff I wished to do. I learned lots of stuff. Explored much,travelled much…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me try to recollect stuff in the order of Months&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;January&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On December 31st,2018 at about 11pm, I received an email regarding the GitHub Campus Experts Program. It stated that my first review was over and I had to improve on stuff. Okay that is not a good one to start the year with but hey I thought that was for the good. 2018 has given me its last blow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2019 in January was full of mixed feelings and wishes…I was still in my S1 then. Specifically I was writing my first sem exams, without knowing which was would I fail first. My new year resolution for 2019 was to improve my profile in GitHub. I started commiting for the first 15 days in one of my private repositories. I did that, by thinking GitHub could be my perfect “Dear Diary”.   &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Jan 14th I went to Kochi-Muziris Bienale. I’m not that much of an art fan but I went there for meeting Sir Richard Stallman, the then FSF Head. Since I was bored by art, I walked nearly 1km to go to the nearest beach and stayed there till noon and again walked 2km to mattanchery to get food. I also got to meet a lot of wonderful student developers in central kerala. I still keep contact with most of them. I met Devdutt Shenoi, Sreeram, Kiran, Subin, Abhijith, George and many others whom I have forgotten the names. 2019’s first Biriyani happened on the same day which was with My dad who then worked in Mattanchery and it was at Kayees, t’was a &lt;strong&gt;kidu&lt;/strong&gt; biriyani. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exams were now over and we were planning to host a Hackathon in college. We had a team set and all, and we planned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went to Velaimkanni in Tamil Nadu that month and got an email at 4am in the morning that my 2nd review for the campus experts program was done and i still needed to be improved. And again college, January ended pretty good and 11% of 2019 was done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;February&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;February was the month which helped me cross off the first thing in my Year checklist, Becoming a Campus Expert. That happened by 24th of February. Thats the best thing I remember in February. I got a project to do for our department’s library. I moved from Windows to Linux and met Sharad Joe,Namitha,Chrisbin, Sumithran and Akshaya at School of AI Kottayam’s first meetup in Kottayam. I got my Hacktoberfest Swags that month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;March&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first week of March, I had a video call from GitHub about the Campus Experts. She was the program manager and that was the first time I had a one-to-one conversation with a person not from India. I got to meet a lot of people from different parts of the world and India itself. I was so excited to join the program and thus I became the &lt;strong&gt;Campus Expert from Kerala&lt;/strong&gt;. I got to be featured in Gopi Chettan’s whatspp status and in TinkerHub’s official Instagram and twitter handles.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We named our Hackathon &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meenachil/Meen Hacks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and Iwas in charge of Sponsorship and Website. I had donemuch work on that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;April&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our college’s Techincal fest was that month but I couldn’t enjoy much since I was suffering from severe Asthma.&lt;br&gt;
I got my swags from GitHub being a campus expert. This included a Hoodie, a Bag and a GitHub Campus Experts Flag. April was okay and it was the time we were meant to host our Hackathon but due to technical issues we had to postpone it. Our S1 results came that month. Those were tough times, and postponing the hackathon had left us low in confidence. The 2nd Sememster exams were also upon us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;May&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I discoverd Termux which could be used to run code on Android. And since my PC was on strike I had to use Termux. I learned Vim and NeoVim and became big fans of it. Study Leaves and Exams. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;June&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;June was full of exams and code. June was a good month. I wrote code on my Phone. I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/athul/wakatime-metrics&quot;&gt;Wakatime Metrics with Json&lt;/a&gt; in this time.
Just the next day after my Physics University exam, I commited the initial one for this blog. I wrote the first two blogs on my Phone. People were telling that I was lying when I told them that I coded my blog on my phone&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;July&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My birthmonth. I was home most of the time due to sem break. Nothing good came that month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;August&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went to my first ever hackathon and that was in Bangalore too. My teammate was Devdutt and that was my travels for the first time.
It was also the month were gonna conduct MeenHacks but on the day before the Hackathon, we had to cancel the event due to imminent rains. I was totally depressed for 2 weeks after the event postponed…Again. Kerala again went to flood mode. I contributed to Kerala Rescue by opening an Issue and Submi  tting a PR review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;when was the last time someone called to wish you a “Happy Birthday”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of us Humans have our Birthdays, this is as true as the sun rises in the east and sets in the west stuff… The universal truth stuff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Otherwise if you’re a robot, you’ll have a manufacturing date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all greet our friends with a lousy “Happy Birthday” in Whatsapp or Instagram (or Facebook) or someother social media platform. This maybe effective in the short term but the level of personalization is nearly equal to 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opininon Birthday Wishes should come from the Heart.Rather than a routine Message through Whatsapp, it should come from your words. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I prefer calling that person on his birthday, it gives a better message that I care and I value you… all that stuff. You took a bit of time to call that friend. It can help you get better with your old friends or relationships. Best of it all, It’ll make the person happy since you’ve called. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next Time call your friends on His/Her Birthday in addition to that whatsapp message.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Go ❤️ Travis+Gorelaser]]></title><description><![CDATA[Past Month, I’ve been wworking on Shelby a lot.

I had set up my CI pipeline using &lt;a href=&quot;https://travis-ci.org/&quot;&gt;Travis CI&lt;/a&gt; by a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.travis.yml&lt;/code&gt; file from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/justjanne/powerline-go&quot;&gt;Powerline Go&lt;/a&gt;.I used a shell script from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/talal/mimir&quot;&gt;Mimir&lt;/a&gt;’s documentaion to help users install the binary or tar.&lt;br&gt;
I had tweaked both of em a bit to make it work for Shelby’s requirements.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Email&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day morning, I e-mailed &lt;a href=&quot;ttps://github.com/talal/&quot;&gt;@talal&lt;/a&gt; since I used some of the source code from Mimir for bootstrapping the project. He was so happy to receive the Email and gave mesome much needed feedback for Shelby. Out of this was one to try out Goreleaser for deployment. So I went on try it. Some other feedback also came from one of my telegram group &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.me/TinkerHub/6839&quot;&gt;TinkerHub&lt;/a&gt; to change the default installation path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll be using goreleaser to Deploy a Go application to GitHub Releases.I am writing this because the Docs were a bit confusing to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Setting Up Goreleaser and Travis CI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the installation Instructions of Gorelaser can be found in their &lt;a href=&quot;https://goreleaser.com/install/&quot;&gt;Official Docs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
After Installing Goreleaser, you just have to &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/code&gt; to that go repository you want to deploy and run &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;goreleaser init&lt;/code&gt;. This command will create a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;goreleaser.yml&lt;/code&gt; already filled with some commands and stuff.      &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here is the Gorelaser part to Deploy the Application to GitHUb Relases&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;yml&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-yml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-yml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;release&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;github&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;owner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &amp;lt;username&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &amp;lt;repo&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can add this to the bottom of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.gorealeaser.yml&lt;/code&gt; file and it’ll work fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For Deploying to GitHub Releases Add this to your &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.travis.yml&lt;/code&gt; file&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;yml&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-yml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-yml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;deploy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;provider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; script
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;skip_cleanup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean important&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; curl &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;sL https&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;//git.io/goreleaser &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; bash
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;tags&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean important&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will only deploy to GitHub releases when a tag is created and pushed. You will need a GitHub Token in the Repo scope and while adding it to Travis Secrets you must name it like &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;GITHUB_TOKEN&lt;/code&gt; only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Some tips before pushing a tags for checking Goreleaser.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can always try goreleaser in you the terminal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;goreleaser release --skip-publish&lt;/code&gt; command and you can always test with this before you push to GitHub.
I’d totally suggest this since I had simply pushed without any testing and I had to write the whole thing…again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;GoDownloader&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can install godownloader from their &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/goreleaser/godownloader/releases&quot;&gt;releases page&lt;/a&gt;. Follow the next steps to use it Globally&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sh&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;$ tar -xvf &amp;lt;filename&amp;gt;.tar.gz
$ mv godownloader /usr/local/bin/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now go to your working folder and run&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sh&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;$ godownloader --repo=&amp;lt;user&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;repo&amp;gt; &amp;gt; godownloader.sh&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will make a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;godownlaoder.sh&lt;/code&gt; file which can be used as an installation script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Here are my Pipelines&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.travis.yml&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;yml&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-yml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-yml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;sudo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean important&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;language&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; go

&lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;go&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;1.13&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;before_script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; go get &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;v

  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;skip_cleanup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean important&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; curl &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;sL https&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;//git.io/goreleaser &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; bash

He was having some trouble speaking since he had a sore throat. He said he wasn’t gonna teach anything but he told everyone to write a paragraph on Love. So I concluded my paragraph like this, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love is like &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Rust&lt;/code&gt;, its friggin fast.
Love is like &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Haskell&lt;/code&gt;, It makes us functional. Love is like &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Clojure&lt;/code&gt;, we won’t understand a damn shit on what’s written(no offence Clojure people).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Love and Other Dumb Stuff&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then I’ve been wanting to write this story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The characters in this post has whatsoever no relation in the real world. If anything relates, that’s just coincidental&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chapter 1 - Love&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2013-15 ish&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so our guy is in his 13th Year on Earth. He is obviously in his high school because in India, High School starts at 8th Standard or Grade. Like every other kid that time he had feelings for a Girl.  She was one of the Studious types in his class. Coincidentally his house was very near to her house. Both of their parents knew each other. One reason he had feelings for her was she had a good personality and not her physical beauty. That times were the times when almost all guys had a love affair from someone in the class or another class.&lt;br&gt;
So in the Fall of 2013s, he professed his love to her. The way he professed was a comedy. So it goes like this. BTW as like every guy, he was good friends with her. So the tide of the class was mostly on discussing love affairs between the class. There was another studious girl in the class too.&lt;br&gt;
So one fine morning she came to him and asked. ”&lt;em&gt;Tell me the truth, you love her right?&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;br&gt;
She had her deductions obviously because he was also a nerd in the class and both the studious girl and he was in the same religion and all.&lt;br&gt;
He got tensed, he said in his breath ”&lt;em&gt;No, It’s you. It’s always been you&lt;/em&gt;”. She was shellshocked. She couldn’t reply to him anything. Telling this he also got tensed, his heartbeat went rising. He got out of class to breathe some fresh air in. His friends came to him and mocked at him for some time, later they asked him all sorts of questions regarding the affair. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since this proposal, he and she didn’t speak. Both of em were still studious as if nothing was going on. Before the exams, one of her &lt;em&gt;Messenger&lt;/em&gt; came to him and told him that she was not able to study because of him. He was dumbstruck, he thought &lt;em&gt;“Why on earth would she be having difficulty in studying if she didn’t have any feelings for me”&lt;/em&gt;. He was never on her tail asking for any reply or any of that matter for sorts. He couldn’t understand that yet he told the messenger to tell her that doesn’t think anything about that proposal of sorts but focus on her studies more. But as any guy who faced rejection even if it is one-way love or anything he goes into a state of depression of sorts. He started listening to Sad Rejection Music from Foreign Bands. He discovered Backstreet Boys and many other sad song bands. Yet he pulled himself together and marched on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast Forward to 2015. He was in his 10th grade. She was shifted to another division. He wasn’t so into her now. Both of them barely minded each other and both of them hadn’t spoken to each other. Reaching by the end of 10th grade, he got a letter from her saying that she Hated him, the whole 1 paragraph tells on how much she hated him. He read it and shredded it to pieces. He didn’t give a shit about it in 2015. He thought on why she’d give something like that to him. He never knew, yet he wouldn’t give a damn on that too…But after the 10th Final Exams, she broke his silence to him while walking to home from the bus-stop. Both of em had to walk home from the Bus-Stop. At last when they reached her home. He walks forward and he told her “I don’t give a damn anymore for you. The next time we see, I’ll call you for my wedding and that’s all from me”. Not the best of his replies but that he made sure that, that reply never hurt her. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2015-ish&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The great tragic proposal failure. Since he didn’t give a damn about her anymore, he met this other girl.  He fell in love with a girl. Again!!. This time he was in the 10th class. He and the new girl had been really good friends but it was so late that he had feelings for her. She had a personality that will make anyone love her. She was so good at conveying stuff and much more. He asked his friends if he should propose to her. One friend is her neighbour and friend said She’ll fall for you. Like all things his friends said, he too later found out that it was not gonna happen. She was perfect, not even a single flaw in his eyes. Later when he proposed to her a damn straight NO was heard from her. He too now was devastated. Now the film song “Azhalinte Aazhangalil” became his most-listened track. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He got past this Affair in Time. That’s all&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chapter 2 - Being Dumb&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s self-explanatory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chapter Closed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;------ The End ---------&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Get GitHub action Notification in Telegram ⚡️⚡️]]></title><description><![CDATA[The Story Behind So, these few days I’ve been working on Shelby a lot.

&lt;p&gt;So, these few days I’ve been working on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/athul/shelby&quot;&gt;Shelby&lt;/a&gt; a lot. For handling the releases section I used Travis CI and Travis really does a good job at it.&lt;br&gt;
The only thing about travis is that it takes time to &lt;em&gt;complete the build and deploy cycle&lt;/em&gt;. Starting with the docker container to the deployment. We’d have to wait in the build page for a few minutes till the build&amp;#x26;deploy is completed. That’s just waste of productive time I’d say. Maybe in that time we could do something else like searhing stackoverflow for a previous error or read the docs to find out how it works better. And to check if the build failed or succeded, I’d have to go back to Travis’ page and meh, it’s just lazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I googled for any solutions to get me notified. I found this medium article where the author made a Shell Script to use it with Travis and sends you a notification on the &lt;strong&gt;build’s status in Telegram using a Bot.&lt;/strong&gt; I didn’t knew that a Shell Script is enough for a telegram bot to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I loved the idea, and copied the script and used it with some changes in the output message. It was fast alright. As soon as the build completed I’d get a Message in Telegram regarding the status. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Story Now&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tweaked the same script to use it along GitHub Actions and boy, its fast alright.
The solution I used before this was a GitHub Action I made for notifying meon Builds using GitHub actions. It was called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/athul/statusoli&quot;&gt;Statusoli&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
I made it using docker actions template and Go. I made different versions for it in different branches of the Repo. The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;star&lt;/code&gt; branch had an output message for notifying about new stars in the repo. The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;notify&lt;/code&gt; branch is for notifying about any new pull  request or issues opened,closed,assigned or reopened. The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; branch is just for sending a message regarding only the build status.
And all of it included a Malayalam Text, I made it just for fun🤷‍♂️.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the shell script for GitHub Actions Telegram Notify is a small one, You can find all of my scripts &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/athul/autom&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You just have to add these lines to the action&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;yml&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-yml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-yml&quot;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Notifier
      &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; $&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; secrets.TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;TELEGRAM_TOKEN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; $&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;secrets.TELEGRAM_TOKEN &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;INPUT_STATUS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; $&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; job.status &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; sh &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;c &quot;$(curl &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;sL https&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;//raw.githubusercontent.com/athul/autom/master/tg_gh_action_noti.sh)&quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;TELEGRAM_TOKEN&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID&lt;/code&gt; should be added to the repository secrets in the repository settings. Be in mind that these Secret’s Name is case sensitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Here the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID&lt;/code&gt; is the chat id you want the bot to send the messages to. You can find your chat id by speaking to &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;jsondumpbot&lt;/code&gt; in telegram. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;TELEGRAM_TOKEN&lt;/code&gt; is your Telegram bot’s API Key. You can create a new bot by talking to &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;botfather&lt;/code&gt; bot in Telegram&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;INPUT_STATUS&lt;/code&gt; is something the actions have, you don’t have to pass anything to it.
The Shell script mostly uses Action’s Environment Variables. So you’d have to define the trigger on which the action should be done. Check &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/events-that-trigger-workflows&quot;&gt;this Guide&lt;/a&gt; for references.
And     &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shelby is a &lt;strong&gt;bash and zsh&lt;/strong&gt; shell prompt with more focus on improving the terminal productivity while not compromising the speed and size. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why??&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use the terminal. I use it a LOT. Mostly editing,running scripts and servers. I use zsh because I ❤️ oh-my-zsh. I used to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/denysdovhan/spaceship-prompt&quot;&gt;Spaceship Prompt&lt;/a&gt; and it felt like quite slow to me. Then I flipped to &lt;a href=&quot;starship.rs&quot;&gt;Starship Prompt&lt;/a&gt; by the awesome &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/matchai&quot;&gt;@matchai&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really fell in love with Starship. It’s fast, it’s built with Rust were too big to be for me to fall in ❤️. The only drawback was that it showed a lot of info. A lot. I didn’t want to customize it much because I was lazy(obviously) and writing another TOML file was meh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then on this fine evening(Dec 2nd) before going to sleep, during to the Study Leaves before my Uni Exams, I thought of writing a shell prompt in Go. I wanted it be &lt;strong&gt;fast&lt;/strong&gt;, to only show the &lt;strong&gt;needed info&lt;/strong&gt;(virtualenvs,SSH and git), and has a &lt;strong&gt;small size&lt;/strong&gt;. The small package size maybe because I use a Macbook Air with 128gigs of storage and not wasting data for downloading the stuff.
I’ve seen Go and Rust programs get photo finishes at speed benchmarks and I thought, why not learn Go on the go and write this Stuff???? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was also the time I found out that Study Leaves increases the productivity and improves out of the box thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I wanted a name for it. I didn’t want it to be a ship anymore but more personally and technically relatable. So I named it &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shelby&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; because &lt;em&gt;Shell+feminine name (because ships are mostly given feminine names🤪)&lt;/em&gt; and my childhood caretaker’s name was Silby😁.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started a bit on it like setting up the repo both local and remote and went to sleep. Since being a total noob to Go(I started learning a few days ago), I searched for any other implementations of the same. I stumbled upon &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/justjanne/powerline-go&quot;&gt;Powerline Go by @justjanne&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/talal/mimir&quot;&gt;Mimir by @talal&lt;/a&gt;. I found both the code hard to follow but grasped their logic in time. Shelby still use mimir’s code in some functions😅.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, forward a few weeks after my 3rd paper(Discrete Mathematics) I got to spend a bit more time into it and on 22nd Decemeber 2019, I released the &lt;em&gt;Alpha&lt;/em&gt; of Shelby. It still has bugs in it but due to my lack of knowledge in Go, I’m still searching for fixes🙂.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of it’s properties are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Small Size(binary ~= 2MB, tar ~= 700KB)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shows if a Virtualenv is enabled&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shows the Username and Hostname if that system is accessed via SSH&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shows the Git branch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shows the number of untracked and unstaged files as &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;[+]&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;[!]&lt;/code&gt; respectively. There will be a count of both of the files unstaged or untracked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find Shelby on GitHub &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/athul/shelby&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; do give it a try and open an issue or two if you find anything unusual😃. It also passed 35 stars on GitHub(my highest starred repo). I also built a GitHub Action to keep me posted on any new stars on telegram just to keep me motivated😊.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d like to also thank&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/GopikrishnanSasikumar&quot;&gt;Gopikrishnan Sasikumar&lt;/a&gt; for providing me with a much needed mental support and being my mentor😇, and my Friend Kiran for the support and ideas .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Using your Old System Better]]></title><description><![CDATA[Using your Old System Better We all went through that stage(most of us), when we buy a New Laptop and we forget about out Old Computer.

&lt;p&gt;We all went through that stage(most of us), when we buy a New Laptop and we forget about out Old Computer. This is a much common trait of us.
Most us has spend a lot of money fixing that old system and improving it. We’ve upgraded the RAM and HDD and still when we get this fancy new laptop and all of a sudden we Forget our PC.
This &lt;strong&gt;Negelected&lt;/strong&gt; peice of ICs and Love could be your next big side project. For me I was totally sad of not using my PC for weeks after buying my Laptop. I even felt empathatic for my PC.
&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.giphy.com/media/xULW8m5Vmtz9oOSFpu/giphy.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Old comp&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What did I do?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So after all this introspection and empathizing, I thought why not set my system to be my Server?
Why not use it as my Storage Space? Why not use it as my Git Server???? Why not my Personal Cloud??????&lt;br&gt;
So I started to work on this stuff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Act 1, SSH&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The First was of course I searched on What should I do? I found a lot of stuff for a server but most of them included booting to a new OS. I didn’t want that. So I searched for other solutions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I currently run Manjaro and Ubuntu on my System and my Laptop is a Macbook. I couldn’t drop neither of my OS. So I continued my Search.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I thought “Hey, I could just SSH into my PC and see what its like.” I spend Half a Day just for the initial Connection. I have a Wifi card and a modem with WIFI, so I justed SSHed into my PC
For SSHing use these commands&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;shell&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-shell&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-shell&quot;&gt;$ ssh-keygen
$ ssh-copy-id host@hostname/ip
$ &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;ssh&lt;/span&gt; host@hostname/ip&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And congratulations you justed SSHed into your PC from a Laptop. :rocket:
Now you get the Terminal of your PC(linux) and you’re like the God of the Terminal now&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can run any commands like &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;curl&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;wget&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;npm install&lt;/code&gt; etc…
&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.giphy.com/media/65n8RPEa3r65q/giphy.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Act 2, Personal Git Storage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GitHub is one of the famous(and my fav) Git Repository storing &amp;#x26; hosting platform. Why not a Personal GitHub lookalike for you? You could save all your private projects here without any risk or Costs.&lt;br&gt;
Some Self Hosted Git Platforms are &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GitLab Community Edition 🆓&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gogs 🆓&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gitea 🆓&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GitHub Enterprize Server 💸&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used &lt;strong&gt;Gitea&lt;/strong&gt; since it was easy to install and setup. You only have to download a binary from gitea.io and voíla you get an instant GitHub lookalike webapp.&lt;br&gt;
My advice is that if you want to use it cross-device install it in the central server and ssh to it from any device and for that(ssh-ing) I’d higly suggest (not a promotion)&lt;a href=&quot;https://termius.com&quot;&gt;Termius&lt;/a&gt;. It has got a 14 day free trial of premium and you can get the pro pack from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://termius.com/education&quot;&gt;GitHub Student Developer Pack&lt;/a&gt;.
Or you can just enter the IP of the server followed by the port number in your browser like &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;192.168.322.12:3000&lt;/code&gt; and you will get the webapp.
Now create some repositories and use Gitea 🎉🎉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Act 3, The File Storage shenanigan&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yep, use it as your personal data center. Store all your stuff. Your films,songs and &lt;em&gt;study materials&lt;/em&gt;. Do it coz only you’re the only one who can access all that since you’re the one who knows how the folder structure is. Add a media server and you can use it with  your Smart TV and forget about paying any bills for streaming.
&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.giphy.com/media/d3mlE7uhX8KFgEmY/giphy.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Roll Safe Meme&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Act 4, The Future&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Wait what? This is what you’ve been Bragging about?” you might ask? I’d say yes since the next big selfhosted stuff maybe your best Ideas. You can self-host anything from Websites, Games to Even Media Servers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some good Places to find out more on what to selfhost&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted&quot;&gt;https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted&lt;/a&gt; The GitHub Repo tells it all&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So for the First Time I went to Bangalore and that too for a Hackathon. The Hackathon was so awesome that I love Hackathons now and Apply for every Hackathon I hear about. Plus I didn’t like Bangalore much because of its dry nature. Its just Bleh. From a person coming from a &lt;strong&gt;Humid Atmosphere&lt;/strong&gt;, it takes time to cope to that one. I’ll write all where it started from to most of the details I remember. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Aug 1st 2019&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the First Day in the 2nd Year of College. I had the train to Bangalore in the evening of the Day. So I had to get all the prior permissions from our Tutuor and our HOD. Phew, our tutor made me run to our department to another part of the Campus twice. Atleast than run made everything smoother for me.
So I headed Home and Packed up for my trip and borrowed the Laptop from my cousin. Thanks to my Uncle who gave me 3 Big Books for my Cousin in Bangalore for His Studies. Damn They were Heavy. So I went to the Railway Station and got on a Train to Ernakulam South where the Train to Bangalore is to be departed. This was my rendezvous point with Devdutt Shenoi. So our train was at 8.35Pm but it was late by Half-an-Hour. The Train Came at 9.15 PM. We got on, my Seat was 2 Bogeys from Devdutt but in the beggining we ate pizza together. 3rd Time I was eating Pizza in 19 Years. Some people got from thrissur and I chatted with them for some time. Went to Sleep. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Aug 2nd 2019&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So since the train was Late. It was stopped in Erode and Held there for an Hour from 4 to 5 AM. We were to reach Bangalore by 8 in the Morning but yet here we are 200 Km from Bangalore. But yet it had its perks. I saw the Eastern Ghats for the First time. The Villages the train Passed in Tamil Nadu. Not eating Breakfast till Noon etc… So anyways we reached Bangalore by 11 AM in the Morning. We were planning to go First to Christ University Campus since Red Hat’s DevConf was being held. It was also an Oppurtunity to meet some fellow Campus Experts. So we got on a Bus from KSR to Christ University Campus. But due to our misinformation that bus was to Another Christ University Campus away from the City. Damn There were 3 Christ Campuses in bangalore Itself. So we got off somewhere and took a Cab to the venue of ETHIndia. We reached the Venue of ETHIndia by 12PM. We found one of our frined Sreeram there Vlogging with his Gimbal Camera. The Food was free and that was so delicious. It was a new cuisine which I had never tasted before. So we ate our Breakfast/Lunch and went to a conference hall. We got in when the guys from Lendroid were talking about their platform. Time passed and I found these things talks quite Boring. I got out of the room and met Anoop who goes by Kai as his handle. He was also from Kerala. Then Subin and Varun came. Then I met Allen and his team mate Ushana. In the evening Sreeram was interviewing Eylon from Do Stack and I met him and we listened to his   story on how he got into Blockchain and stuff. Then there was a talk from Vitalik, the founder of Ethereum.&lt;br&gt;
The hackathon actually started in the Evening by 7 PM. All of us were given a Bag with 2 Notebooks, Some Stickers and 4 Tshirts. Then I met Syam&lt;em&gt;ettan&lt;/em&gt; from Mozilla Kerala.He was the maintainer of Keralarescue.in . He was there for some venue arrangements. Then I also met two volunteers for the Hackathon who were friends of Syamettan. We started hacking on something dealing with IPFS and Decentralization. I made the frontend for the stuff. Time passed by. Then I actually met the person sitting infront of me who was also a Malayali. I was thrilled when I heard he was from Pala, Kottayam. At least someone who understands my slang(Kottayam’s Malayalam is the best form of malayalam. The other guys were not from Kottayam though, so it was hard for them to understand some words I was saying). A midnight we went just for a walk with Syamettan. We wanted a coffee but no shops were open. we came back. Oh I didnt tell you about the unlimited supply of &lt;strong&gt;Monster&lt;/strong&gt; Energy Drink Right? Yep unlimited.&lt;br&gt;
Then we slept till the morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Aug 3rd 2019&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2nd Day at the hackathon. Hoo we were excited. Ate our Breakfast talked to some people and so on. But then I saw this  Sticker on a Laptop. It was an &lt;strong&gt;expertocat&lt;/strong&gt; and only GitHub Campus Experts had this to give away. So I went there and asked them from where they got this and talked and made friends with them. They were from Vadodara, Gujarat. And to our suprize one of them was from Kerala. He was born and brough-up in Gujarat though. They were so Friendly towards us. My Teammate Devdutt went for his Neice’s Birthday party on the same day. So I was there siting with my Laptop without any formal idea on what we were doing. God it was frustrating. Then I and My Friend Kai(Anoop) tried to hack on something but it didn’t work out.&lt;br&gt;
Then I ctually met this Kid from Ernakulam. He is a fellow mallu yet I didn’t speak to him much though. To my amazement he was a Google Code-In finalist and worked for Postgres. His name was Allen. We talked all Night with Drinking Monsters. We even made stacks of monster bottles. Devdutt came back at 4:00PM. Then again we did something more to the Hack. We again spoke to the guys from Gujarat. We talked about GitHub, New Technologies, how some websites work. They showed me some of their open source Projects. We got about 3 more extra Tshirts the same day. Between this time I called Went to sleep at 3AM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Aug 4th 2019&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Final day of the Hackathon. We got up at about 8 AM . Submitted our Project and left the venue at about 10:00 AM. Just before Leaving we got another Tshirt from the Organizers for playing Dumb-Charades with my friend Sreeram. I called my cousin and he came with a Scooter to pick me up. We then went to his apartment. From there we went see my Sister who was working as a Pharmacy Doctor in Bangalore. I went to meet her. I also met an ISRO Engineer there who was a friend of her. From there  went to meet 2 of my other cousins. It’s been 3 years since I had ssen him and his family. I got to meet my nephew  for the first time. We ate lunch, He bought me another T shirt. On our way to the railway station, he showed m the offices of Microsoft, Oracle and some big corporates. So at about 5 PM I got on the Train for Home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I reached home at about 7:00 AM on 5th. Dressed up and went to College the same Day. EthIndia was a one-of-a-kind experience for me. I don’t even know anything about Ethereum still.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[My System Setup]]></title><description><![CDATA[Coding is one of my favorite Hobbies apart from Music and Films.

&lt;p&gt;Ever see in any issues or Pull Request in GitHub where a bot comments on the PR/Issue or adds labels to the PR/Issue? If you have, they are generally termed as GitHub apps and can be made relatively easily.&lt;br&gt;
Most of these apps are written in JavaScript (Node.js) using &lt;strong&gt;Probot&lt;/strong&gt;, a framework for building apps for GitHub. Probot is written in Typescript, a superset of JavaScript. You can find more about on their &lt;a href=&quot;https://probot.github.io&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Here we’ll make a &lt;strong&gt;Simple Issue and Pull Request commenter&lt;/strong&gt; bot which is made and deployed on Glitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GitHub account&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An account on Glitch using GitHub&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basic JavaScript knowledge like variables and strings and functions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Making our App on Glitch&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glitch is a free online code-editing platform. It sets up our environment with all the necessary packages and stuff. All you need to do is click this button👇 and you’ll get a full working environment for your “Remixing”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- Remix Button --&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://glitch.com/edit/#!/remix/twilight-marquis&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.glitch.com/2bdfb3f8-05ef-4035-a06e-2043962a3a13%2Fremix%402x.png?1513093958726&quot; alt=&quot;remix this&quot; height=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Probot does is that it abstracts the authentication system that all GitHub Apps have to follow - letting you focus on writing API requests without worrying about API tokens or permissions.&lt;br&gt;
Probot ships with an example of setting up an issue commentor bot in &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;index.js&lt;/code&gt;.
We’ll edit the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;index.js&lt;/code&gt; to the following &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//index.js&lt;/span&gt;
module&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function-variable function&quot;&gt;exports&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;app&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Your code here&lt;/span&gt;
 app&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;Yay, the app was loaded!&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
 app&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;issues.opened&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;context&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; issue&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;context&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;payload&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;issue &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//getting issue details&lt;/span&gt;

   You are awesome..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token template-punctuation string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; params &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; context&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;issue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; message &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; context&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;github&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;issues&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;createComment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;params&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above code is for a bot which comments on new issues. It mentions the user too. The &lt;em&gt;“Robotic”&lt;/em&gt; characteristics start from the 4th line starting with &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;app.on&lt;/code&gt; function the first argument passed is the action which the bot listens to. These are &lt;strong&gt;webhook&lt;/strong&gt; events of GitHub - you can learn more about them from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.github.com/webhooks/&quot;&gt;Webhook Documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
Probot uses Node’s &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;async/await&lt;/code&gt; API for returning the data. We used the &lt;em&gt;`&lt;/em&gt; character to enclose the string/comment body because we won’t need to use escape characters and we can also interpolate &lt;a href=&quot;https://flaviocopes.com/javascript-template-literals/&quot;&gt;Template Literals&lt;/a&gt;.         &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we need to check if our app is working or not, we can do this &lt;strong&gt;clicking&lt;/strong&gt; on a “sunglasses” button on Glitch which should look like this &lt;br&gt;&lt;span

    &lt;/span&gt;
Click the &lt;strong&gt;Register GitHub App&lt;/strong&gt; button and provide a name and install it in a repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tip: Create a new private repository because we’ll be making a lot of noise for the testing   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Now, if you check the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt;  file you’ll see the variable values auto-filled with the necessary data. Glitch automatically deploys our app and our app will be listening to the webhooks to be received.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Test the app by making a new issue in a test repo on GitHub.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; It works right?&lt;br&gt;
Congratulations 🎉🎉 You just made yourself a GitHub App👌👌 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Redelivering Webhook⤴️&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can view all the webhooks of any event triggered by the Repository and we can redeliver them by going to &lt;strong&gt;Settings-&gt;Developer Settings-&gt;GitHub Apps-&gt;“Your app name”-&gt;Advanced Tab&lt;/strong&gt; in your profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Commenting on PRs&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to add an extra permission for our App to comment on PRs, we can provide that by going to &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Settings-&amp;gt;Develope Settings-&amp;gt;&amp;lt;Your_app_name&amp;gt; -&amp;gt; Permissions and Events -&amp;gt; Pull Requests&lt;/code&gt; Provide the read and Write Access.&lt;br&gt;
Now we need to edit the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;index.js&lt;/code&gt; to add Support for Pull Request before the last &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//index.js&lt;/span&gt;
app&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;pull_request.opened&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;context&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; pr &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; context&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;payload&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;pull_request
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; user &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; pr&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;user&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;login &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;//Collecting Details of the person who created the PR&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; msg&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;context&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;issue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;body&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token template-string&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token template-punctuation string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;Hey @&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;user&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt; :wave: Thanks for the PR !!! You are Awesome.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token template-punctuation string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; context&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;github&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;issues&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;createComment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;msg&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Here we add a new &lt;em&gt;“robotic”&lt;/em&gt; characteristic by passing a webhook action called &lt;em&gt;pull_request.opened&lt;/em&gt;. Now our app listens for PR webhook and once received it emits the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;context.issue({body})&lt;/code&gt; to GitHub. You can see that we are still passing the body to the &lt;em&gt;createComment&lt;/em&gt; function. This is because PRs are considered as another type of Issues in GitHub.
For testing if this works, make a new PR and check if the bot comments on that yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations on making a GitHub app. Since it is on Glitch we can install this in any repository and it will work any time too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can customise the comments with Images and Gifs but keep in mind that the comments render markdown.
You can always import these files to a GitHub repository through Glitch.&lt;br&gt;
Now go forth, explore and make some exciting GitHub apps,❤️❤️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Thanks to&lt;/h5&gt;

Then you’ll know how tiresome it is to &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;checkout&lt;/code&gt; to every branch and typing &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;git push &amp;lt;branch name&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; . If you haven’t encountered this,try doing it once, you’ll know what I’m saying😏😏.&lt;br&gt;
We could always automate these stuff just by a few line of shell code.It’s quite &lt;strong&gt;easy&lt;/strong&gt; you know. Starting by taking the above said situation,you’ve got 5 branches and you want to push to all these 5 branches. We’ll write a shell script for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token builtin class-name&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; ~/path/to/git/repository/ &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;#Assuming you are anywhere&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token for-or-select variable&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;master&apos;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;dev&apos;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;fix1&apos;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;patch1&apos;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;dope-branch-name&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; checkout &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;$i&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; pull origin &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;$i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; push origin &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;$i&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This 7 line script can help you save some keystrokes.You should save this script with a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.sh&lt;/code&gt; extension and can be  run by typing &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;sh script_filename.sh&lt;/code&gt; So now,what does this mean? It’s the same thing you type in the terminal with a for loop as for extra a &lt;em&gt;“dev”&lt;/em&gt; touch😁😁.&lt;br&gt;
The looping variable &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; will loop through the strings we’ve passed through, these will be our branch names and inside the for loop the variable is passed by a &lt;em&gt;$&lt;/em&gt; prefix. Now wherever we use the &lt;em&gt;$&lt;/em&gt; as prefix for the variable name,the script will automatically pass the variable’s value, just like that :snap:⚡⚡.  Everything that needs to be executed inside the loop should be between the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;done&lt;/code&gt; keywords. The loop will go on till the parameters are over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let us make a script which runs a python program,saves its output to another file and commits it and git push it.
Here I’ll be pushing it to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com&quot;&gt;Gist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
So some days ago I started using (Wakatime)[] which gets track on your coding activity and its super cool,showing it off in your GitHub profile seemed cool and one &lt;a href=&quot;phamous.dev&quot;&gt;Campus Expert,John Pham&lt;/a&gt; did do it and it looked super cool. But the way he did was using GitHub Actions, and no I didn’t apply for the Beta of GH Actions. So I made a Python🐍 script to make something like his. You can find it &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Athul-CA/wakatime-metrics&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
It’s a tad manual since API requests are 😰😱. The manual thing is you’ve got to copy a json file from your wakatime dasboard’s “embed” page. The rest of the work is done by a shell script👻👻. For showing the activity in my Profile too,I made a public gist with a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.txt&lt;/code&gt; file in GitHub and cloned it to my local machine. The shell script goes like this,👇👇&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token builtin class-name&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; ~/path/to_the/python_file and json &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;file&lt;/span&gt;
nvim filename.json
python main.py filename.json &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ~/path_to_cloned_gist_repo/filename.txt
&lt;span class=&quot;token builtin class-name&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; ~/path_to_gist_repo
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; commit -a -m &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;New Metrics&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; push origin master&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When running this script, you’ll be first prompted to paste the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;json&lt;/code&gt; text you copied from the Wakatime dashboard. You should delete the current contents and paste the new ones and save it. You can use any editor of your choice, I use NeoVim. It will run the python program and it will push the changes to GitHub. Easy Right? Just with a few line of Bash Script we can automate quite a good amount of Tedious Tasks.&lt;br&gt;
We can set up a script for launching the terminal just as the System turns on but I believe its for you to find out more about it. This post might’ve helped and possibly this will be the needed push for you to explore the world of shell scripting and automation✌️✌️✌️.&lt;br&gt;
I will post some more on this when I understand more of this some day.👻&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Programming on your Phone]]></title><description><![CDATA[What is Termux?

&lt;p&gt;Termux is a &lt;strong&gt;Terminal Emulator&lt;/strong&gt; which can be used on Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why Termux?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Start by answering the Whys”- Simon Sinek&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Termux is quite useful if you are a aspiring dev and doesn’t have a budget to buy a laptop or If your machine goes on frequent strikes(as for me). You can do mostly anything that you do in a Linux terminal, like exploring files,editing them,moving them and using tools for Python,C,JavaScript(Node) etc…&lt;br&gt;
Termux is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Light Weight(few kilobytes)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Works same as the Bash in Linux&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Managable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open Source&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has a package manager/repository&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supports many Packages and Compilers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can use the full potential of phone’s computing power&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Super handy(for devs) while travelling or related tasks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Installing Termux&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Termux can be installed from &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google Play or F-Droid&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.
We can &lt;em&gt;simply&lt;/em&gt; install it from either of these sources and it’ll work on-the-go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Setting Up Termux&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accessing the Termux file system is a tedious one and is hard to find(for me) but we can provide acces to termux to our internal storage by going to &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;setting&amp;lt;apps&amp;lt;termux&amp;lt;permissions&lt;/code&gt; Toggle the permission for storage to ON state. Or, you can provide access by running &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;termux-setup-storage&lt;/code&gt; and you can access the file system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Installing Packages&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Termux has a sleek package manager which is constantly improved by the community. It has almost all packages we can find on Linux distributions and repositories. We can install packages by calling &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;pkg install &amp;lt;package_name&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; . We can see a list of all the arguments to be used with &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;pkg&lt;/code&gt; by running &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;pkg help&lt;/code&gt;.
Here,I’ll show an example on how to install git and neovim with Termux&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;pkg install git&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;pkg install neovim&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Its that simple.&lt;br&gt;
There might be a problem with the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;curl&lt;/code&gt; command and we can resolve it by running &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;pkg upgrade&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
We can install &lt;strong&gt;Node,Python and C&lt;/strong&gt; packages too,using &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;pkg install&lt;/code&gt; command.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What can we do&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can use version control using Git&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can edit files using Neovim or Nano&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can run servers with python or npm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can get a new session by sliding from the left&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS.

New people,new place, New possibilities… &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Pre-College Drama&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But most of the beginning of College &lt;em&gt;for me&lt;/em&gt; started about &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;2 months&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;  ago after my entrance examination. Oh, I was totally sure I’d come here in Kidangoor as my performance in exams was way off the charts and this was my only best option for Engineering.&lt;br&gt;
So I started &lt;em&gt;researching&lt;/em&gt;. I searched in every social media I could find, I checked Facebook,Instagram,Twitter,Youtube and Even GitHub(there was nothing much there:sweaty_smile:). I also found about one of my seniors in school who was studying here,I had contacted him and asked for his feedback(He is now known by Chacko/Albin)
It was this time I’ve found about technical communities in Kochi and Kottayam. I’ve joined a Telegram group from Kottayam and asked if anyone was fron CE Kidangoor, I’ve got a reply from Joseph who is a senior here. He was the second person I’ve met before college.Later on I met Gokul Bro and EC Chechi.&lt;br&gt;
After joining college  I met Abhinav, he was the second person I met from my Class.He still remains to be my best bud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;First Meetup&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward a Few weeks, I went for my First Meetup.I met Abhijith Bro and Akshay chettan and many others there. They were all astonished to see a first year boy in an Intro to ML workshop. It was totally awesome to meet them and to visit Kochi.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Class and College&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Class was totally boring but Classmates were totally cool and the college had an another level of Vibe. I loved going to college not for the classes but for just being there for the &lt;strong&gt;Vibe&lt;/strong&gt;. No, There was no special girl there(not even now😅&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Open Source📦&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had made an account in GitHub in Ju ly but it became active in mid September. Me and Abhinav had a plan to make the Python Programs for the programming lab Open Source for the future students. Abhinav was the Free Software guy then and I was the Open Source guy. We together with some seniors made the &lt;strong&gt;Open Source Community&lt;/strong&gt; here.&lt;br&gt;
My mentor GKS told me the value of the GitHub profile and I made repos for the silliest of things(even now 😁).This was the first time I explored GitHub, Learned Git, and found out about the Campus Experts Program.I applied for the Student Developer pack in October and got it. This was also the time I E-met Musthaq Ahamed he is totally cool and one of the awesomest guys I have met. He is one of the most patient guys I have known,oh how much I annoyed him with my messages and If were in his position I would’ve snapped long ago. I completed Hacktoberfest too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;First Hackthon and Sticker💻&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The funny thing is that I never attended any Hackathon. I organized one without any prior knowledge with my seniors in December first as Local Hack Day from MLH. That was the first time I got a sticker for myself and an &lt;em&gt;octocat&lt;/em&gt;, Oh how I wished to get one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Octocats and stickers are cool &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was also when I organized a workshop,2 people from my class came and the rest were all seniors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My seniors are &lt;strong&gt;Cool and Super Awesome&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Post-University Exams🎓&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Damn,Calculus was rough&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went again to a handfull of workshops and talks, I contributed to some Open Source Repositories in GitHub. I joined TinkerHub, which is a community spread throughout Kerala and is growing rapidly. In the mean time I met Subin who was a core contributor to KeraLinux and FOSS guy,Sreeram the Android Guy, Pranav who helped me with one of my projects amd Kiran the Web Dev also with Abhijith the Pythonista and Devdutt the IEEE guy. I also had the oppurtunity to meet Dr.Richard Stallman,the father of the GNU project(Got stickers). I also met an Engineer who was working in GitLab and attendes his talk on how he got the job with Open Source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;School of AI&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the first best thing for the Technical community in  Kottayam apart from the clubs in Colleges. This was totally an Independant community which is managed by different people in different colleges. I am one of the organizers here. For our first meetup, I met Sharad bro,Chrisbin,Namitha and Akshaya Chechi and Rushtam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;To Linux🐧&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abhinav had now became a super &lt;em&gt;Cyber Security&lt;/em&gt; guy and installed Linux on a 160GB HDD of mine. Using linux is Bliss. I am not fond of using windows now but I dont hate Microsoft. I also moved from Python to Js.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The 5 month Long CE Journey🚩&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had applied for Campus Experts program in the Latter Half of October and Got Selected in the First week of November. In their website there was a map of showing the Campus Experts around the world,and couldn’t find anyone from Kerala there this made me apply for it. I met Manu S Pillai who was a CE from Kerala and was living in Delhi. Yep he was a Python guy.&lt;br&gt;
On March’s first Sunday I got a mail saying(in a way) that I have become a Campus Expert I was on CloudNine when I saw this. Later that week,I met Lieke Boon who was the Student Program Manager at GitHub via video call. She explained to me about how the program works and related matters in a 30min call. I’ve met other CEs in our messaging platform and yes they are Totally cool. Some of the Indian CEs were from IITs,NITs and IIITs and there was me who was from a Tier3 college in a small corner of Kerala and I felt so honoured to be here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Meenachil Hacks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By this time I met Samanyu Bro and Akshay Bro in college who are my seniors and Samanyu bro is the Lead of InfinCEK another technical community here. Akshay bro is the Web Developer here and he is one of the awesomest people in college.Me with another 10 people put forward for Meenachil Hacks. We made a website got stickers and funding for the event and it is going to be in August 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Swag Count💖&lt;/h3&gt;
