This maybe effective in the short term but the level of personalization is nearly equal to 1. </p>\n<p>In my opininon Birthday Wishes should come from the Heart.Rather than a routine Message through Whatsapp, it should come from your words. </p>\n<p>I prefer calling that person on his birthday, it gives a better message that I care and I value you… all that stuff. You took a bit of time to call that friend. It can help you get better with your old friends or relationships.
