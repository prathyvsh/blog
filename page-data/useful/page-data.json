This is a much common trait of us.\nMost us has spend a lot of money fixing that old system and improving it. We‚Äôve upgraded the RAM and HDD and still when we get this fancy new laptop and all of a sudden we Forget our PC.\nThis <strong>Negelected</strong> peice of ICs and Love could be your next big side project. For me I was totally sad of not using my PC for weeks after buying my Laptop. I even felt empathatic for my PC.\n<img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/xULW8m5Vmtz9oOSFpu/giphy.gif\" alt=\"Old comp\"></p>\n<h3>What did I do?</h3>\n<p>So after all this introspection and empathizing, I thought why not set my system to be my Server?\nWhy not use it as my Storage Space? Why not use it as my Git Server???? Why not my Personal Cloud??????<br>\nSo I started to work on this stuff. </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Act 1, SSH</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>The First was of course I searched on What should I do? I found a lot of stuff for a server but most of them included booting to a new OS. I didn‚Äôt want that. So I searched for other solutions</li>\n<li>I currently run Manjaro and Ubuntu on my System and my Laptop is a Macbook. I couldn‚Äôt drop neither of my OS. So I continued my Search.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Then I thought ‚ÄúHey, I could just SSH into my PC and see what its like.‚Äù I spend Half a Day just for the initial Connection. I have a Wifi card and a modem with WIFI, so I justed SSHed into my PC\nFor SSHing use these commands</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"shell\"><pre class=\"language-shell\"><code class=\"language-shell\">$ ssh-keygen\n$ ssh-copy-id host@hostname/ip\n$ <span class=\"token function\">ssh</span> host@hostname/ip</code></pre></div>\n<p>And congratulations you justed SSHed into your PC from a Laptop. :rocket:\nNow you get the Terminal of your PC(linux) and you‚Äôre like the God of the Terminal now</p>\n</li>\n<li>You can run any commands like <code class=\"language-text\">curl</code>,<code class=\"language-text\">wget</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">npm install</code> etc‚Ä¶\n<img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/65n8RPEa3r65q/giphy.gif\"></li>\n</ol>\n<hr>\n<h3>Act 2, Personal Git Storage</h3>\n<p>GitHub is one of the famous(and my fav) Git Repository storing &#x26; hosting platform. Why not a Personal GitHub lookalike for you? You could save all your private projects here without any risk or Costs.<br>\nSome Self Hosted Git Platforms are </p>\n<ul>\n<li>GitLab Community Edition üÜì</li>\n<li>Gogs üÜì</li>\n<li>Gitea üÜì</li>\n<li>GitHub Enterprize Server üí∏</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I used <strong>Gitea</strong> since it was easy to install and setup. You only have to download a binary from gitea.io and vo√≠la you get an instant GitHub lookalike webapp.<br>\nMy advice is that if you want to use it cross-device install it in the central server and ssh to it from any device and for that(ssh-ing) I‚Äôd higly suggest (not a promotion)<a href=\"https://termius.com\">Termius</a>. It has got a 14 day free trial of premium and you can get the pro pack from the <a href=\"https://termius.com/education\">GitHub Student Developer Pack</a>.\nOr you can just enter the IP of the server followed by the port number in your browser like <code class=\"language-text\">192.168.322.12:3000</code> and you will get the webapp.\nNow create some repositories and use Gitea üéâüéâ</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Act 3, The File Storage shenanigan</h3>\n<p>Yep, use it as your personal data center. Store all your stuff. Your films,songs and <em>study materials</em>. Do it coz only you‚Äôre the only one who can access all that since you‚Äôre the one who knows how the folder structure is. Add a media server and you can use it with  your Smart TV and forget about paying any bills for streaming.\n<img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/d3mlE7uhX8KFgEmY/giphy.gif\" alt=\"Roll Safe Meme\"></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Act 4, The Future</h3>\n<p>‚ÄúWait what? This is what you‚Äôve been Bragging about?‚Äù you might ask? I‚Äôd say yes since the next big selfhosted stuff maybe your best Ideas. You can self-host anything from Websites, Games to Even Media Servers</p>\n<p>Here are some good Places to find out more on what to selfhost</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted\">https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted</a> The GitHub Repo tells it all</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/</a> The Epic Place to get all the info .</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Using your Old System Better","date":"December 14, 2019","description":"Using your Old System as your Private Server,GitHub, Cloud and Whatnot"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/useful/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/Bangalore/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"ETHIndia/Bangalore Days"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/shelby/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Shelby, the Shell Prompt"}}}}}
