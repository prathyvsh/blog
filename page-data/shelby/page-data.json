I use it a LOT. Mostly editing,running scripts and servers. I use zsh because I ‚ù§Ô∏è oh-my-zsh. I used to use <a href=\"https://github.com/denysdovhan/spaceship-prompt\">Spaceship Prompt</a> and it felt like quite slow to me. Then I flipped to <a href=\"starship.rs\">Starship Prompt</a> by the awesome <a href=\"https://github.com/matchai\">@matchai</a>. </p>\n<p>I really fell in love with Starship. It‚Äôs fast, it‚Äôs built with Rust were too big to be for me to fall in ‚ù§Ô∏è. The only drawback was that it showed a lot of info. A lot. I didn‚Äôt want to customize it much because I was lazy(obviously) and writing another TOML file was meh.</p>\n<p>Then on this fine evening(Dec 2nd) before going to sleep, during to the Study Leaves before my Uni Exams, I thought of writing a shell prompt in Go. I wanted it be <strong>fast</strong>, to only show the <strong>needed info</strong>(virtualenvs,SSH and git), and has a <strong>small size</strong>. The small package size maybe because I use a Macbook Air with 128gigs of storage and not wasting data for downloading the stuff.\nI‚Äôve seen Go and Rust programs get photo finishes at speed benchmarks and I thought, why not learn Go on the go and write this Stuff???? </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This was also the time I found out that Study Leaves increases the productivity and improves out of the box thinking.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Then I wanted a name for it. I didn‚Äôt want it to be a ship anymore but more personally and technically relatable. So I named it <strong><em>Shelby</em></strong> because <em>Shell+feminine name (because ships are mostly given feminine namesü§™)</em> and my childhood caretaker‚Äôs name was SilbyüòÅ.</p>\n<h2>Code</h2>\n<p>I started a bit on it like setting up the repo both local and remote and went to sleep. Since being a total noob to Go(I started learning a few days ago), I searched for any other implementations of the same. I stumbled upon <a href=\"https://github.com/justjanne/powerline-go\">Powerline Go by @justjanne</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/talal/mimir\">Mimir by @talal</a>. I found both the code hard to follow but grasped their logic in time. Shelby still use mimir‚Äôs code in some functionsüòÖ.</p>\n<p>So, forward a few weeks after my 3rd paper(Discrete Mathematics) I got to spend a bit more time into it and on 22nd Decemeber 2019, I released the <em>Alpha</em> of Shelby. It still has bugs in it but due to my lack of knowledge in Go, I‚Äôm still searching for fixesüôÇ.</p>\n<p>Some of it‚Äôs properties are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Small Size(binary ~= 2MB, tar ~= 700KB)</li>\n<li>Shows if a Virtualenv is enabled</li>\n<li>Shows the Username and Hostname if that system is accessed via SSH</li>\n<li>Shows the Git branch</li>\n<li>Shows the number of untracked and unstaged files as <code class=\"language-text\">[+]</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">[!]</code> respectively. There will be a count of both of the files unstaged or untracked.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can find Shelby on GitHub <a href=\"https://github.com/athul/shelby\">here</a> do give it a try and open an issue or two if you find anything unusualüòÉ. It also passed 35 stars on GitHub(my highest starred repo). I also built a GitHub Action to keep me posted on any new stars on telegram just to keep me motivatedüòä.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôd like to also thank<a href=\"https://github.com/GopikrishnanSasikumar\">Gopikrishnan Sasikumar</a> for providing me with a much needed mental support and being my mentorüòá, and my Friend Kiran for the support and ideas .</p>\n<p>Thanks</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Shelby, the Shell Prompt","date":"December 26, 2019","description":"Shelby is one of my Side Projects.
