You can do anything and everything. Believe in that‚Äù - Swami Vivekananda</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You might be thinking why I started with a quote by Swami Vivekananda. This quote has been a driving factor in my pursuits to learn new things and building stuff and moving forward. </p>\n<p>I have been into Go for about 2 months now. I just wrote up two hacks in Go too. One was <a href=\"https://github.com/athul/shelby\">Shelby</a> and now lemme introduce you to <a href=\"https://github.com/athul/pwcli\">Postwoman CLI</a>. As the name says It‚Äôs a CLI client for <a href=\"https://postwoman.io\">Postwoman üëΩ</a>  in Go.</p>\n<h2>The ‚Äò0‚Äô üë¶</h2>\n<p>Learning either Go or Rust was in my TODO list of 2019. It was only in late 2019, I had reached the mindset to learn Go. I started out on tutorials in building servers in Go. I used to code servers in Python and falled for Backend Programming. I made a bunch of servers in Go with Gin. Go was intimidating at first since it felt more like C to me, but in a few days I got the clutch of it. I still don‚Äôt actually know most of Go like using slices and goroutines that much. I learn mostly by building so, I learn when I build.</p>\n<h2>The ‚Äò-1‚Äô üë∂</h2>\n<p>I met Liyas Thomas, the author of Postwoman in the official Telegram Group of Postwoman. Since he too was from the state of Kerala, we had a few convos. I had opened a PR to Postwoman when it launched in August-September but it didn‚Äôt get merged due to my lack of Vue/Js. But later on I had a chat with him if I did a refactor PR. He really gave me the confidence to do that and I did. The PR was reviewed and made changes by the Maintainers of PW and where it started in 1 commit it changed to 8 and the diff was <strong>+8k and -8k</strong>. The PR got merged and I was the <strong>#11 Contributor of PW üéâ.</strong> The PR didn‚Äôt give me any satisfaction but later after 2 days, Liyas send me a bug and told me to try to fix that. I traversed over 2k lines of Vue code and found the bug. He made a commit and fixed it. This bug squashing gave me much satisfaction than all the contributions I‚Äôve done. Later that week, a maintainer and My Friend James made a repo for a CLI in Js. So the idea for making another CLI was basically for learning for me.</p>\n<h2>The ‚Äò1‚Äô üë®</h2>\n<p>So, Liyas gave a Green Flag to work on the CLI. I considered Go as first option since I didnt know how to make one in any lang and Go was fresh in my mind. I built it in almost 2 weeks. <code class=\"language-text\">pwcli</code> is like <em>httpie</em> with displaying the Request Headers and Status Code and Output Highlighting. The Output is now limited to Json but will add support to HTML and XML in the coming days. <strong>It also has a <code class=\"language-text\">send</code> feature in which you can give it the Postwoman-Collection.json file and it will test all the endpoints in their respective methods and output the status code</strong>. This was actually a feature request in the Js counterpart of the CLI.    </p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">NAME:\n   Postwoman CLI - Test API endpoints without the hassle\n\nUSAGE:\n   cli <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>global options<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span> <span class=\"token builtin class-name\">command</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>command options<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>arguments<span class=\"token punctuation\">..</span>.<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span>\n\nVERSION:\n   <span class=\"token number\">0.0</span>.2\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n   Made with <span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span><span class=\"token number\">3</span> by Postwoman Team\n\nCOMMANDS:\n   get      Send a GET request\n   post     Send a POST Request\n   put      Send a PUT Request\n   patch    Send a PATCH Request\n   delete   Send a DELETE Request\n   send     Test all the Endpoints <span class=\"token keyword\">in</span> the Postwoman Collection.json\n   help, h  Shows a list of commands or <span class=\"token builtin class-name\">help</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">for</span> one <span class=\"token builtin class-name\">command</span>\n\nGLOBAL OPTIONS:\n   --help, -h     show <span class=\"token builtin class-name\">help</span>\n   --version, -v  print the version</code></pre></div>\n<p>You can find <strong>PwCLI</strong> in GitHub at <a href=\"https://github.com/athul/pwcli\">https://github.com/athul/pwcli</a>.
