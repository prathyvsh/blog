You can do mostly anything that you do in a Linux terminal, like exploring files,editing them,moving them and using tools for Python,C,JavaScript(Node) etc…<br>\nTermux is</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Light Weight(few kilobytes)</li>\n<li>Works same as the Bash in Linux</li>\n<li>Managable</li>\n<li>Open Source</li>\n<li>Has a package manager/repository</li>\n<li>Supports many Packages and Compilers</li>\n<li>Can use the full potential of phone’s computing power</li>\n<li>\n<p>Super handy(for devs) while travelling or related tasks</p>\n<h4>Installing Termux</h4>\n<p>Termux can be installed from <em><em>Google Play or F-Droid</em></em>.\nWe can <em>simply</em> install it from either of these sources and it’ll work on-the-go.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Setting Up Termux</h4>\n<p>Accessing the Termux file system is a tedious one and is hard to find(for me) but we can provide acces to termux to our internal storage by going to <code class=\"language-text\">setting&lt;apps&lt;termux&lt;permissions</code> Toggle the permission for storage to ON state. Or, you can provide access by running <code class=\"language-text\">termux-setup-storage</code> and you can access the file system.</p>\n<h4>Installing Packages</h4>\n<p>Termux has a sleek package manager which is constantly improved by the community. It has almost all packages we can find on Linux distributions and repositories. We can install packages by calling <code class=\"language-text\">pkg install &lt;package_name&gt;</code> . We can see a list of all the arguments to be used with <code class=\"language-text\">pkg</code> by running <code class=\"language-text\">pkg help</code>.\nHere,I’ll show an example on how to install git and neovim with Termux</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">pkg install git</code></li>\n<li>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">pkg install neovim</code><br>\nIts that simple.<br>\nThere might be a problem with the <code class=\"language-text\">curl</code> command and we can resolve it by running <code class=\"language-text\">pkg upgrade</code>.<br>\nWe can install <strong>Node,Python and C</strong> packages too,using <code class=\"language-text\">pkg install</code> command.  </p>\n<h4>What can we do</h4>\n</li>\n<li>We can use version control using Git</li>\n<li>We can edit files using Neovim or Nano</li>\n<li>We can run servers with python or npm</li>\n<li>We can get a new session by sliding from the left</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>PS.
